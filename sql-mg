-- For each product in the database, calculate how many more orders where placed in 
-- each month compared to the previous month.

-- IMPORTANT! This is going to be a 2-day warmup! FOR NOW, assume that each product
-- has sales every month. Do the calculations so that you're comparing to the previous 
-- month where there were sales.
-- For example, product_id #1 has no sales for October 1996. So compare November 1996
-- to September 1996 (the previous month where there were sales):
-- So if there were 27 units sold in November and 20 in September, the resulting 
-- difference should be 27-20 = 7.
-- (Later on we will work towards filling in the missing months.)
